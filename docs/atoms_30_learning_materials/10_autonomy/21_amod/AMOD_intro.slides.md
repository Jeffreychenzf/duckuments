## Visions for autonomous vehicles

- Vision 1 - **Use autonomous vehicles for Dangerous, Dull, Dirty jobs** â–¶

    - Pushed by military interest (e.g. DARPA Grand Challenge)

- Vision 2 - **Your next car can drive by itself** â–¶

    - Natural evolution of driver assistance system.


- Vision 3 - **Autonomous Mobility on Demand** â–¶

    - Mobility is a service. Nobody owns a car. (Do you own any train?)
    - The cars have no steering wheel.
    - We donâ€™t need parking spaces.
    - Level 4 is sufficient.

- Variation: freight instead of people.

## The race for AMOD

- [Waymo](https://waymo.com/) (Google) **[AMOD]**

- [Tesla Autopilot project](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/autopilot?redirect=no)

- [Uber Advanced Technologies](https://www.uber.com/info/atg/) **[AMOD]**

- [Cruise Automation](https://getcruise.com/) **[AMOD]**

- [nuTonomy](http://nutonomy.com/) **[AMOD]**

- [Zoox](http://zoox.com/) **[AMOD]**

- All automakers have AV divisions:

    - [Toyota Research Institute](http://www.tri.global/)
    - BMW **[AMOD]**
    - [Audi](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/06/audi-is-the-first-to-test-autonomous-vehicles-in-new-york/)
    - [Nissan](https://www.nissanusa.com/blog/autonomous-drive-car)
    - [Baidu](http://usa.baidu.com/adu/)

- (?) Apple "Project Titan"

## Why AMOD is an easier target, technically {#/easier}

- **Comparing the two visions:**

    - Vision 2 - Your next car can drive by itself. â–¶
    - Vision 3 - Autonomous Mobility on Demand. â–¶

- **Technical advantages of AMOD:**

    - I choose **where** and **when** to deliver the service. â–¶
    - I can have remote **supervisors** (1 supervisor: 50 cars). â–¶
    - I donâ€™t have to worry about (mis)users of the system. â–¶
    - Every night, my cars come back to the garage (think, e.g., **calibration**). â–¶
    - My cars are always updated (Each car lasts ~200,000 miles = 2 years) â–¶

## Social benefits of AMOD {#/benefits}

- Reduced accident fatalities

- More livable cities â–¶

    - No need for parking spaces
    - Fewer cars to provide the same service.


- City-level fleet management allows more efficient uses of resources.

    - You can plan service with demand.
    - City-level fleet coordination reduces traffic.
    - You can integrate with rail.

## Benefits of fleet management
