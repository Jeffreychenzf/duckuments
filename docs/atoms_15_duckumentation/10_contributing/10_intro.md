# Overview {#duckumentation-intro status=ready} 

TODO: write more about the design principles.

## Where the documentation is

All the documentation is in the repository `duckietown/duckuments`.

The documentation is written as a series of small files in Markdown format.

It is then processed by a series of scripts to create  publication-quality PDF and an online HTML version.

You can find all these artifacts produced at the site [`docs.duckietown.org`](http://docs.duckietown.org).

## Editing links

The simplest way to contribute to the documentation is to click any of the "âœŽ" icons next to the headers.

They link to the "edit" page in Github. There, one can make and commit the edits in only a few seconds.
